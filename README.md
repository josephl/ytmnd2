Finding Forrester 2 - ytmnd2
============================

Gus Van Sant's long awaited sequel was an exercise in various JavaScript frameworks and tools, such as Backbone.js, Underscore.js, Require.js, and jQuery.

Although the soundtrack has yet to be scored, you may find the film [here](http://josephl.github.com/ytmnd2).

You may edit the film as you please. In the file `js/ytmnd2.js` edit the values for `bg` and `zoomText` at the top accordingly.
